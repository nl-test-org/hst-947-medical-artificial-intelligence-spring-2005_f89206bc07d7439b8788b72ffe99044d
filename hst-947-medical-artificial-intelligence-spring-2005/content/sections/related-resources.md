Interactive Lectures and On-line Exercises
------------------------------------------

There is a complete set of online audio lectures for 6.034 by Professors Tomás Lozano-Pérez and Leslie Kaelbling, which are matched to lecture slides, full transcripts, and lecture handouts. There are also interactive homework problems using an online tutoring system, called XTutor, that is being developed by the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. With the tutor, students fill in answers and ask the computer to check and score their answers.

The materials, including interactive access to the online tutor, are being made publicly available for teaching and for self-study by OpenCourseWare in cooperation with the Outreach project of MIT iCampus.

MIT iCampus, sponsored by Microsoft® Research, is aimed at achieving broad, substantial, and sustainable impact on higher education through information technology. iCampus incubates innovations for labs, classrooms, and campus communities at MIT and promotes their dissemination around the world.
